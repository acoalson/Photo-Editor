# CS042 Photo Editor

This project is a homework assignment for the Harvey Mudd CS042 course which implements several photo filters, found in the [src/edu/hmc/photo](src/edu/hmc/photo) directory. In particular, the seam carving algorithm is from [this paper](http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf).
